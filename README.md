# Purpose
I am using an existing jekyll theme created by [qwetl](https://github.com/qwtel) to genereate a website where I can share passion projects, general musings and thoughts after reading articles, and my progress with learning new skills. The idea behind this is a way to hold myself accountable, learn a bit more about web development, and document my progress overtime.
