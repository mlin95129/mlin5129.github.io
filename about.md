## About Me

Hey! I am Michael, a product manger by day and avid gamer/napper/friend/learner whenever not working. I currently work at a tech company to develop new product offerings that would help customers monitor, manage, and maintain their hybrid cloud infrastructure environments. 

In my free time I enjoy playing games, watching shows, hanging out with friends, and when I am motivated learning something new through articles, books, courses, videos, friends, etc.

This website was generated mainly to document my progress in learning something new throughout the year. The idea behind this is a way to not only hold myself accountable but also to share what I do learn during my journey of focusing on progression rather than end results.

## Progression over perfection
