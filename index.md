I am a product manger at a tech company working on datacenter hardware infrastructure solutions focused on management, as a service offerings, and new product offerings for customers. 

In my free time I enjoy playing games, watching shows, hanging out with friends, and when I am motivated learning something new whether it be a new skill or story of someone I met.

This website was generated mainly to document my progress in learning something new throughout the year. The idea behind this is a way to not only hold myself accountable but also to share what I do learn during my journey of focusing on progression rather than end results.
